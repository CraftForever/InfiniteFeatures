#### Building & Installing from source

1. Download the git repository (source files) manually or by running the following command:

```git clone https://github.com/CraftForever/InfiniteFeatures.git```

2. Ensure you have [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) installed on your computer
2. Open a terminal/cmd and navigate into the git repository you downloaded `.../InfiniteFeatures/`
3. Run `gradlew build` in your command line.
4. A `.jar` file will be created and placed in `InfiniteFeatures/build/libs/`
5. Install Minecraft Forge (you'll have to google this)
6. Copy that `.jar` file into your `.minecraft/mods/` folder
7. The latest (and likely most buggy) version of the mod should be installed
